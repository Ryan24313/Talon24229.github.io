        <div class="box">
            <p>I created the api for OnlyPogs</p>
        </div>
        <p>This was my first time making an API, and working for OnlyPogs, the API is intended to be highly flexible with even a built in randomize feature for those to make games, that need pog data.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <div class="box">
            <p>I created the now defunct DBPannel</p>
        </div>
        <p>The DBPannel was the first version for OnlyPogs to have a built in admin control panel so that to update the database, it could remain live.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <div class="box">
            <p>I created Faz Quotes</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            A mostly joke website that started with the base idea of the character freddy saying randomly made quotes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This later became the Faz Terminal, where I host other's creations, and my own personal projects
    </p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <div class="box">
            <p>I recreated a Minireena minigame, with functioning settings</p>
        </div>
        <p>Creating this minigame was decently complex with 8 assets needing to load in specific locations when live.</p>
        <p>When retouching this game I added controls and settings to make the game easier or harder</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <div class="box">
            <p>Here is a snippet of its code</p>
        </div>
        <p>In this code you can see the logic for how the enemies, Minireenas climb the up the sides of the screen, when they reach the top you lose.</p>
        <p>Underneath is the logic for how to remove this enemy by pressing keys on your keyboard, they fall off.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <div class="box">
            <p>I recreated the Fun With... minigame, with a selection screen</p>
        </div>
        <p>This game features 3 modes, BB, Plushtrap, and a hard mode.</p>
        <p>The website has not database, and instead uses cookies to track personal data.</p>
        <p>The stars only show up when you have beaten that game mode.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <div class="box">
            <p>Here is a snippet of its code</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Inside this snippet, the speed variable is created, calculating how fast the enemy should be.
        </p>
        <p>
            When specially BB is selected balloons are then created as visual distractions.
        </p>
        <div>

            At the bottom logic for the light is implemented, if you hold a key the light stays on.</div>
